The basic setup uses default settings, while the advanced setup provides additional options such as container type, root password, hostname, disk size, core count, RAM size, network settings, and others. The options are presented in a dialog box format using the whiptail command and the script collects and validates the user's input to generate the final configuration of the container or virtual machine.</sub>
